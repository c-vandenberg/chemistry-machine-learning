## 1.1.1 Introduction To The Molecular Graph Representation

The vast majority of the molecular representations discussed in this literature review are built on the concept of the molecular graph representation. It is therefore important to introduce the theory behind molecular graphs and gain a solid understanding of it. This will primarily involve the abstract mathematical structure/data structure of the graph itself, however it is importatnt to note that notations and file formats such as **SMILES strings** and **Molfiles** are also build using molecular graphs. **<sup>1</sup>**

Molecular graph representation is based on the concept of **mapping a molecules atoms and bonds into sets of nodes and edges**. Typically, the nodes are represented using letters indicating the atom type (as per the periodic table), or simply using points where the bonds meet (for carbon atoms). **<sup>1</sup>**

A molecular graph representation is formally a **2D object** that can be used to **represent 3D information/spatial relationships**. For example, a molecular graph can contain information such as **atomic coordinates**, **bond angles** and **chirality**. However, because graph nodes only show **pairwise relationships**, this spatial information must be **encoded as node and/or edge attributes**. **<sup>1</sup>**

Typically, in schematic representations of graphs, the nodes are represented representated using circles or spheres, and the edges using lines (**Fig 1**). The 2D and 3D representations of graphs can be visualised by many software packages, such as **ChemDraw**, **<sup>2</sup>** **Avogadro**, **<sup>3</sup>** and **VMD** **<sup>4</sup>**

## 1.1.2 Mathematical Defintion of a Graph

A graph is formally/mathematically defined as a **tuple** *G=(V, E)* of a **set of nodes** *V*, and a **set of edges** *E*, where each edge element *e* in set *E* (*e ∈ E*) **connects a pair of nodes v** from set *V* (*v ∈ V*).

Intuitively, we can think of set *V* as being a set of **all atoms in the molecule**, and set *E* being a set of **all bonds in the molecule**. This is typically the convention, but it **does not have to be the case**.

Molecular graphs are typically **undirected**, meaning the **pairs of nodes that define each edge are unordered**.

In order to construct a concrete, programmatic representation of a graph from this abstract mathematical concept, we need to **map the sets of nodes and edges to linear data structures**. Common data structures used to do this are **arrays** or **matrices**. A linear data structure is required in order to **specify the connectivity of the nodes**. Therefore, despite the face that the ordering in the sets is irrelevant, an **artificial node-ordering** in order to **encode a molecule using arrays or matrices**. 

The molecular information to be mapped to the graph can be:
1. How atoms are connected in the molecule
2. The identity of the atoms
3. The identity of the bonds

### How atoms are connected in the molecule - Adjacency Matrix

The most common representation for **how the atoms are connected** in a molecule is an **adjacency matrix** (sometimes known as a **connectivity matrix**, **Fig 2b**). An adjacency matrix works as follows:
1. For adjacency matrix **A**, *a<sub>ij</sub>* is an element of **A**
2. If *a<sub>ij</sub> = 1*, then a **bond exists** between nodes *v<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>j</sub>* in molecular graph *G*
3. If *a<sub>ij</sub> = 0*, then a **bond does notexists** between nodes *v<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>j</sub>* in molecular graph *G*
4. **N.B** An adjacency matrix only specifies a bonds exists, it does not specify what type of bond exists

### The Identity of Atoms - Node Features Matrix

The most common representation for **the idendity of atoms** in a molecule is a **node features matrix** (**Fig 2c**), which works as follows:
1. For node features matrix **X**, each **row** of **X** corresponds to a node *v<sub>i</sub>* (i.e. an **atom in the molecule**) in molecular graph *G*
2. This row is also referred to as the **node feature vector** *x<sub>i</sub>* for that atom
3. The **length** of *x<sub>i</sub>* corresponds to the **number of atom features** you have chosen to encode
4. For example, in **Fig 2c**, a **one-hot encoding** of atom type and formal charge has been chosen (i.e. the atom types and formal charges are represented as a **binary value** so that they can be **fed into machine-learning (ML) algorithms**)

### The Identity of Bonds

The most common representation for **the idendity of bonds** in a molecule is a **edge features matrix** (**Fig 2d**), which works as follows:
1. For edge features matrix **E**, each **row** of **E** corresponds to an edge *e<sub>ij</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub>,v<sub>j</sub>)* (i.e. the **bond between atoms i and j**) in molecular graph *G*
2. This row is also referred to as the **edge feature vector** *e<sub>ij</sub>* for that edge
3. The **length** of *e<sub>ij</sub>* corresponds to the **number of bond features** you have chosen to encode
4. For example, in **Fig 2d**, a **one-hot encoding** of possible bond types {single, double, triple, aromatic} has been chosen

### One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is a technique in data science whereby **categorical information data is converted into a binary vector**. It is common in ML algorithms as it helps to **preserve information & improves prediction**, and **makes the dataset compatible with various types of ML algorithms**. This is because many ML algorithms **cannot work with categorical data directly**, and require all input & output variables to be **numeric**.

Therefore, with one-hot encoding, **each unique category value is assigned a binary vector** that has **all zero values**, except for the **index of the category**, which is given a value of **1**.

The main drawback of one-hot encoding is that it can lead to a **large increase in data dimensionality**, especially a the categorical variable has many categories. This is often referred to as the **curse of dimensionality** **<sup>6</sup>**

## 1.1.3 Graph Traversal Algorithms

As discussed before, although graphs themselves are **non-linear data structures** made up of sets of nodes & edges, in practice, **matrix representations of graphs are node order dependend**. **<sup>1</sup>**

The node order used in a matrix representation is determined by a **graph traversal algorithm** (**Fig 3**). It is often important to **reliably/consistently generate the same matrix representation of the same molecule**, and this is dependent on **generating the same node order** each time. Therefore, the way in which the graph traversal algorithm **breaks ties** when a node branches off must be consistent so that the algorithm **consistently selects the same branch traversal order**.

To achieve this consistency, a **depth-first** or **breadth-first** search algorithm can be used. If however, consistency is not important, a **random serarch** algorithm can be used.

fullest extent, then goes back and explores branches at the last branched node, until all branches have been explored. <b>b</b> A breadth-first search first
explores all nearest neighbours of a node, and then the nearest neighbours of the nearest neighbours, and so on, until the whole graph has been
explored. <b>c</b> A random search explores nodes in the graph in an arbitrary order, regardless of how they are connected <b><sup>1</sup></b>

## 1.1.4 Molecular Graph Reprentations

The matrix representations discussed in **1.1.2** are **not the only way to represent graphs**. As discussed in **1.1.3**, depending on **what graph traversal algorithm is used**, the **order of the rows in atom/bond block will be different**.

Indeed, when constructing molecular graphs, there is not one correct way to represent any molecule and the representation chosen must be appropriate for the task. **<sup>1</sup>**
