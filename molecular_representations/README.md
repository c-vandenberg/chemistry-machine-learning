# 1 Molecular Representations in Machine Learning-Based Drug Development

## 1.1 Introduction 

With the advancement of deep learning (DL) technology, the growth of drug-related data, and the proliferation of user-friendly DL frameworks in popular programming langauages, **<sup>1</sup>** **<sup>2</sup>** methodologies based on machine learning (ML) algorithms are becoming more ubiquitous in all steps of the drug discovery & drug development process. **<sup>3</sup>**

Data quality and data representation have a significant impact on the performance of ML-based predictive models as both heavily contribute to the quality of pre-training. Therefore, there has been a surge of interest in research on molecular representation
