# 1 Molecular Representations/Descriptors in Machine Learning-Based Drug Development

## 1.1 Introduction 

With the advancement of deep learning (DL) technology, the growth of drug-related data, and the proliferation of user-friendly DL frameworks in popular programming langauages, **<sup>1</sup>** **<sup>2</sup>** methodologies based on machine learning (ML) algorithms are becoming more ubiquitous in all steps of the drug discovery & drug development process. **<sup>3</sup>**

Data quality and data representation have a significant impact on the performance of ML-based predictive models as both heavily contribute to the quality of pre-training. Therefore, there has been a surge of interest in research on molecular representation. This includes pre-computed/fixed molecular representations such as **molecular graph representions**, **linear notations** (e.g. SMILES & molecular fingerprints), **<sup>4</sup>** **<sup>5</sup>** as well as **learned molecular representations**. **<sup>6</sup>**.

This literature review serves as an introduction to the different molecular representation approaches in ML-based drug development. The review covers the following topics:

1. **Molecular Graph Theory**
2. **Molecular Descriptors** - Classified according to their **dimensionality**:
  *  0D molecular descriptors
  *  1D molecular descriptors (including **1D molecular fingerprints**)
  *  2D molecular descriptors (including **SMILES** and **2D molecular fingerprints**)
  *  3D molecular descriptors
